Lab 12: Azure Virtual Network Design with Multi-Subnet Architecture (Web & DB Tier Isolation)
📌 Overview

In this lab, I designed and implemented a custom Azure Virtual Network (VNet) with multiple subnets to simulate a real-world, production-style application architecture.

Instead of relying on Azure’s default networking during VM creation, the network was explicitly designed first, followed by deploying virtual machines into appropriate subnets based on their role (Web vs Database).

This approach mirrors how enterprises and SRE teams design secure, scalable, and maintainable cloud networks.

🎯 Objective

Understand why VNets are required in enterprise environments

Design a multi-subnet network architecture

Deploy:

A Web VM with public access

A Database VM with no public exposure

Understand:

IP addressing

Subnetting

CIDR

NIC behavior

Apply security-first and SRE-oriented networking principles

🏢 Why Companies Need a Virtual Network (VNet)

In real organizations:

Applications must not run on public networks

Traffic must be controlled, inspected, and segmented

Teams need:

Predictable IP addressing

Isolation between tiers (Web, App, DB)

Secure internal communication

An Azure Virtual Network (VNet) provides:

A private, isolated network in Azure

Full control over:

IP ranges

Subnets

Routing

Security rules

💡 SRE perspective:
A well-designed VNet reduces outages, limits blast radius, and simplifies troubleshooting.

🌐 VNet Design Used in This Lab
Virtual Network Details

VNet Name: vnet-dev-cind-01

Address Space: 10.0.0.0/16

Region: Central India

Resource Group: rg-az104-dev-cind

This address space allows 65,536 private IP addresses, giving room for future growth.

VNet Overview

🧠 Networking Fundamentals (Core Concepts)
1️⃣ IP Address

An IP address uniquely identifies a resource in a network.

Example:

Web VM private IP: 10.0.0.4

DB VM private IP: 10.0.1.4

SRE relevance: IP consistency is critical for monitoring, firewall rules, and incident debugging.

2️⃣ CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

CIDR defines how many IPs a network contains.

Examples used:

10.0.0.0/16 → VNet

10.0.0.0/24 → Web Subnet

10.0.1.0/24 → DB Subnet

CIDR	Total IPs
/16	65,536
/24	256
3️⃣ Subnet

A subnet divides a VNet into smaller logical networks.

Why subnets matter:

Security isolation

Traffic control

Clear role separation

🧩 Subnet Architecture (Web & DB Tier)
Subnet Name	Address Range	Purpose
snet-dev-cind-web-01	10.0.0.0/24	Web tier
snet-dev-cind-db-01	10.0.1.0/24	Database tier
Subnet View

🖥️ Web Tier VM Deployment
Web VM Details

VM Name: vm-dev-cind-web-01

Subnet: snet-dev-cind-web-01

Private IP: 10.0.0.4

Public IP: Assigned

Purpose: Internet-facing application server

Web VM Overview

🔌 Network Interface (NIC) Behavior

When a VM is created, Azure automatically creates:

A Network Interface (NIC)

Assigns:

Private IP from the subnet

Optional public IP

NIC IP Assignment

Key observation:

The IP 10.0.0.4 was dynamically assigned from 10.0.0.0/24

💡 AZ-104 exam tip:
NICs, not VMs, are associated with IPs and NSGs.

🛢️ Database Tier VM Deployment (Secure by Design)
DB VM Details

VM Name: vm-dev-cind-db-01

Subnet: snet-dev-cind-db-01

Private IP: 10.0.1.4

Public IP: ❌ None

Purpose: Internal database server

Why No Public IP?

Prevents internet exposure

Reduces attack surface

Enforces access only from Web tier

🔐 SRE principle:
“Private by default, public only when required.”

🔐 Security & SRE Design Principles Applied

✔ Network segmentation
✔ Principle of least exposure
✔ Clear tier separation
✔ Scalable IP planning
✔ Real-world enterprise pattern

🔁 Traffic Flow (End-to-End)
Internet
   |
   | (Public IP)
   v
Web VM (10.0.0.4)
   |
   | (Private VNet traffic)
   v
DB VM (10.0.1.4)

🧪 Verification

Web VM accessible via public IP

DB VM not reachable from internet

Web VM can communicate with DB VM internally

IPs correctly allocated from respective subnets

🧹 Cleanup (Cost Control)

To avoid unnecessary Azure costs:

Delete resource group: rg-az104-dev-cind

📚 AZ-104 Skills Covered

Virtual Network design

Subnet planning

CIDR calculation

NIC behavior

Secure VM deployment

Public vs private IP usage

🚀 Why This Lab Matters for an SRE Role

This lab demonstrates:

Intentional architecture (not defaults)

Security-aware design

Troubleshooting-ready layout

Production-grade thinking

This is exactly how real systems are built and reviewed by SRE and Cloud Engineering teams.
